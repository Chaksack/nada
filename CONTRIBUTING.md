2. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository
3. Fill out the pull request template completely
4. Ensure all CI checks pass
5. Address any feedback from reviewers

## üìã Coding Standards

### Go Code Guidelines

- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comprehensive comments for exported functions
- Keep functions focused and small (ideally < 50 lines)
- Use interfaces to define behavior
- Handle errors explicitly
- Write table-driven tests where appropriate

### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] Code follows Go best practices
- [ ] All new code has corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`make test`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`make fmt`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`make lint`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated if necessary
- [ ] Security checks pass (`make security`)

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use table-driven tests for testing multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Test Structure

```go
func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    InputType
        expected OutputType
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid input",
            input:    validInput,
            expected: expectedOutput,
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        // Add more test cases...
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := FunctionName(tt.input)
            if tt.wantErr && err == nil {
                t.Errorf("expected error but got none")
            }
            if !tt.wantErr && err != nil {
                t.Errorf("unexpected error: %v", err)
            }
            if got != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", got, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```
